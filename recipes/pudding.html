    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Are you f*cking crazy? Of course we’re going to have the banana pudding.
      We’re just going to doctor up the stuff from the box with crazy amounts of
      gently whipped cream and caramelized bananas and Nilla wafers crushed with
      melted butter. Yes, you could make the pudding from scratch, but this is
      just as good. No, this is better: It takes seconds to set up, then you go
      in, and it tastes like you made real pudding. Pro tip: Top this with
      really good, grassy-green olive oil (like California Olive Ranch) and a
      light hand with the sprinkles. The olive oil really picks up notes of
      green banana—it’s amazing. And the sprinkles? Next. Who makes banana
      pudding with sprinkles?

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        3 small (3.4 ounce/96 g) boxes Jell-O banana cream instant pudding and
        pie filling
      </li>
      <li>4 cups (1 quart/L) whole milk</li>
      <li>4 cups (1 quart/L) heavy cream</li>
      <li>1¼ tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
      <li>16 ounces (2 sticks/226 g) unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 box (11 ounces/311 g) Nilla wafers</li>
      <li>4 ripe bananas</li>
      <li>¼ cup (67 g) brown sugar</li>
      <li>Pinch ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>Extra virgin olive oil, optional garnish</li>
      <li>Multicolor sprinkles, optional garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl whisk the dry pudding with the milk. Set the bowl
        in the refrigerator to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make whipped cream, in another large mixing bowl whip the heavy cream
        with the sugar with a whisk or hand mixer just until soft peaks form.
        <br />
        Gently fold 3 cups (720 ml) of the whipped cream into the pudding
        mixture so that it is well incorporated. Fold in more as needed until
        the pudding is light and fluffy (and tastes like homemade pudding, not
        like something out of a box). Put the pudding and any leftover whipped
        cream in the refrigerator.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, melt one of the sticks of butter and pour it into
        the bottom of a baking dish or another mixing bowl. Use your hands to
        crumble about 2/3 of the box of Nilla wafers into the baking dish. Stir
        the cookies into the butter with a spoon or spatula until it forms a
        loose crumble. Set this aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the second stick of butter in the same skillet over medium heat.
        Peel the bananas, cut them in half (not lengthwise), and add them to the
        skillet when the butter begins to bubble. Sprinkle the brown sugar and
        the cinnamon over the top.
        <br />
        Cook the bananas, swirling them in the pan or moving them around with a
        spoon, until both are coated in the butter–brown sugar mixture. Let it
        cook until the mixture begins to look like lava and starts to crinkle
        up, then remove the pan from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve the banana pudding, you can make one large dessert or several
        small ones: Put down a few inches of Nilla wafer–crumble, then top it
        with a few more of caramelized bananas, making sure to get some sauce.
        Add a few hefty spoonfuls of chilled banana pudding, then top with a
        little more crumble. (If you are using a tall container, repeat these
        layers one or two more times as needed.)
        <br />
        Then top the whole thing with a generous dollop of whipped
        cream—pressing down the layers if need be to make the whipped cream
        fit—and finish with a drizzle of olive oil, sprinkles, and a few
        crumbled plain Nilla wafers.
