    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Beloved Louisianian chef Isaac Toups has been making this recipe since he
      was a kid. This gumbo is meant to come out rich and flavorful, so Toups
      does not recommend skimming the chicken fat off the top of the gumbo.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
      <li>3 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grapeseed oil</li>
      <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 large red bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>2 ribs celery, diced</li>
      <li>10 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>4 bay leaves</li>
      <li>12 ounce amber-style beer</li>
      <li>5 cup chicken stock</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>
        1 pound andouille sausage (or your favorite smoked sausage), cut into
        bite-size pieces (½-inch half-moons)
      </li>
      <li>rice for serving</li>
      <li>sliced green onions, for garnish</li>
      <li>pepper paste, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400°F. Season the chicken thighs with 2 teaspoons of
        the salt and 1 teaspoon of the black pepper. Place on a rimmed baking
        sheet, skin side up, and roast for 20 minutes, or until the skin is
        lightly browned. Remove from the oven and set aside. Don’t throw that
        fat away, it’s going in the gumbo later.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a heavy Dutch oven over medium heat, make a dark roux by simmering
        the oil and flour for about 45 minutes. Once the roux is the color of
        milk chocolate, add the trinity of onion, bell pepper, and celery and
        stir once every 5 seconds for about a minute until the vegetables begin
        to soften and caramelize. The roux is rocking hot, so these vegetables
        are going to cook really quickly. Don’t walk away! After a minute, add
        the garlic and bay leaves and cook for another 30 seconds, stirring
        frequently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deglaze the pot with the beer, scraping the bottom with a wooden spoon
        until all the browned bits are released. Stir constantly until it
        returns to a simmer. Add the stock and continue stirring until it
        returns to a simmer. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon
        black pepper and the cayenne. Add the reserved chicken thighs (skin,
        bones, everything) and their fat and the sausage. Bring back to a bare
        simmer, being careful not to let it boil and not to let the roux scorch,
        reduce the heat to the lowest setting on your stove, and cover. Simmer
        for 3 hours, stirring every 30 minutes, scraping the bottom each time.
        Your gumbo should begin to thicken, but not like gravy. If it starts
        getting too thick before the 3 hours are up and you have to hit it with
        a little water to thin it, do so.
      </li>
      <li>Do not skim that fat off the top.</li>
      <li>
        Serve with rice. Garnish with sliced green onions. If you want to bump
        up the heat, add a little scoop of pepper paste.
